# Practicals for IT@JCU CP1401/CP1801/CP5639 - Programming 1

This repository contains instructions and resources for practicals for the subjects CP1401, CP1801 and CP5639 at James Cook University.  
Complete instructions are found in each prac folder.

**These practicals are for six-week offerings of CP1401. If you are enrolled in a 10 or 13-week offering, please go [here](https://github.com/CP1401/Practicals/tree/master).**

## Practical Content

* [Practical 1 - Problem Solving and Algorithms](./prac_01)
* [Practical 2 - Decision Structures](./prac_02)
* [Practical 3 - Repetition Structures and Coding Checkpoint 1](./prac_03)
* [Practical 4 - Functions](./prac_04)
* [Practical 5 - Lists and Coding Checkpoint 2](./prac_05)
* [Practical 6 - Files and Strings](./prac_06) 

## Practicals are assessed

You should aim to complete the work in the practical session, but you
have one additional week to complete each of these tasks and still earn
your mark. If you do not finish a practical in the scheduled week, you
can still get full marks if you show it to your practical supervisor at
the **start** of the next practical. After that, it's too late.

Assessment will be based on completing the tasks up to but not including
the practice/extension section. You will be marked as follows:

- 4 = Excellent response to all questions (Always aim for this!)
- 3 = Good response to most or all questions, but some omissions or problems
- 2 = Reasonable response to some questions, but some significant omissions or problems
- 1 = Reasonable response to at least one question
- 0 = Minimal or no attempt

**Note**: This subject is all about learning best practices and patterns for solving problems using programming (in Python) and it is important that you learn these important foundations according to the teaching philosophy of the subject. For this reason (to help you learn properly!), you will not achieve full marks for working/complete practicals that are not done in the way that we prescribe. Here are some reasons that you might lose marks for your practicals (and assignments):

- Your work looks too similar to any provided solutions
- Your work includes concepts and code not taught in the subject
- You miss or skip part of a question (you must attempt all requirements for all questions)
- Your work does not follow the core concepts and patterns (e.g. using global variables, while True loops or similar techniques), even if they work!

## Save your practical work
You need to save your work from every prac. Keep every file/script you write.  
We suggest you use a USB disk and cloud storage (like OneDrive) and organise it using folders, like `CP1401/practicals/prac_01`.    

Give each file a logical name so you can find it again. Also, when you need to make changes to an existing script for a separate question, make a copy of the old question first so you have a record of everything.  
Don't save your work to the JCU computers' local drives, but into your own storage area. You can use the local hard drive for temporary storage, then move your work onto your disk or cloud storage.  

For important work like assignments, please make sure you have multiple backups.
