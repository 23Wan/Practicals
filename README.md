# Practicals for IT@JCU CP1401/CP5639 - Programming 1

This repository contains instructions and resources for practicals for the subjects CP1401 and CP5639 at James Cook University. 

## Solutions!

You are on the `solutions` branch of the Practicals repository.  

There are no instructions in this branch, only solutions.  
For the normal instructions, please select `master`.  

Selected (not all) practical solutions are provided here, in this branch.  
These are to help you learn by evaluating your own work and seeing our suggested ways of solving the practical problems.

**Important:** Please use the solutions in a mature and honest way, as helpful learning tools...  
_after_ you complete your own work, not as something to simply copy into your own prac work. OK?  
**Seriously**, _never copy the solutions_ as this will _not_ help you learn as much as doing your own coding.
