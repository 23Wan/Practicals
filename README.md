## Practicals are assessed

You should aim to complete the work in the practical session, but you
have one additional week to complete each of these tasks and still earn
your mark. If you do not finish a practical in the scheduled week, you
can still get full marks if you show it to your practical supervisor at
the **start** of the next practical. After that, it's too late.

Assessment will be based on completing the tasks up to but not including
the practice/extension section to a satisfactory standard (not getting
everything correct). You will be marked as follows:

0. not attempted at all
1. some of the work attempted with minimal effort
2. some of the work attempted with reasonable effort
3. most or all of the work attempted with good effort

Note that to get full marks, you must have attempted every part of every question. Make sure you read the questions carefully, and do everything required.

*Please have __all__ of your tasks open and ready to show your tutor when
it's time to get marked.*

## Save your practical work
You need to save your work from every prac. Keep every file/script you write.  
We suggest you use a USB disk and cloud storage (like OneDrive) and organise it using folders, like `CP1401/practicals/prac_01`.    

Give each file a logical name so you can find it again. Also, when you need to make changes to an existing script for a separate question, make a copy of the old question first so you have a record of everything.  
Don't save your work to the JCU computers' local drives, but into your own storage area. You can use the local hard drive for temporary storage, then move your work onto your disk or cloud storage.  

For important work like assignments, please make sure you have multiple backups.
