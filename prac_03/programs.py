# 4. Dog years
# Write a Python program to calculate a dog's age in dog's years.
#
# To do this â€“ Each year of the first two years is equal to 10.5 human years.
# After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.
#
# Expected Output:
# Input a dog's age in human years: 15
# The dog's age in dog's years is 73

# Note: This solution contains "magic numbers".
# It would be good to use CONSTANTS for these, but seems acceptable as it is
# (partly due to how silly this whole dog years thing appears :)
