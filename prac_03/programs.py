# 4. Dog years
# Write a Python program to calculate a dog's age in dog's years.
#
# To do this â€“ Each year of the first two years is equal to 10.5 human years.
# After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.
#
# Expected Output:
# Input a dog's age in human years: 15
# The dog's age in dog's years is 73

# Note: This solution contains "magic numbers".
# It would be good to use CONSTANTS for these, but seems acceptable as it is
# (partly due to how silly this whole dog years thing appears :)

age_in_human_years = int(input("Age in human years: "))

# 5. Rock of Ages
# Ask the user for their age, then tell them what you think of them.
# Use a compound Boolean expression to test if the age is valid
# (between 0 and 120 inclusive) and print "Invalid age" if it's invalid.
# Then print your own personal response for how old they are.
# You decide how many different responses you want.
#
# NOTE: This is an important question, to get used to determining an items place within the infinite numeric range.
# Notice how we start by ruling out the largest portion of the numberline (search space) and that we
# DO NOT REPEAT questions we already know the answer to.

    print("Hi teenager :)")
elif age < 60:
    print("Getting there...")
else:
    print("Enjoy your senior discounts!")

# Notice the use of the if-elif-else pattern. We DO NOT need to ask a last question
# (e.g., if age >= 60 because we know that already.
# We do not need a nested structure.
# We do start at one end (in this case low, but it could have been high) and keep checking in the same direction
# There are no "and" expressions.
