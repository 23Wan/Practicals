"""CP1401 Practical 7 - Suggested Solution - Questions"""

1. Where should global constants be placed in a program?
At the top - after import statements

2. What are two reasons why you should not use global variables?
They make the program harder to debug since they could be changed anywhere by any function.
They make functions (which use those globals) harder to reuse.

3. When you have two variables with the same name but in different functions, these said to have different ____?
Scopes

4. What do you call the red dot in the margin in PyCharm that pauses the program running when using the debugger?
Break point

5. Briefly explain what would be wrong if you had a line of code like SOME_VALUE += 1 (assume that SOME_VALUE is actually a meaningful name).
Since the name is ALL_CAPS, it must be a constant... but it's being changed, so it should remain constant or be a (lowercase name) variable.

6. What is the single most important design principle for designing functions?
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), or loosely, "Do one thing"
