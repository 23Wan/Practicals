CP1401 Practical 04 - Repetition Structures - Suggested Solutions

## Quick Questions

1. What is the PyCharm keyboard shortcut for commenting (out/in) a selection of code?
    Ctrl (or Command) /
2. What are the two kinds of loops available in Python?
    Definite (for)
    Indefinite (while)
3. What is a "sentinel" (when dealing with loops)?
    A sentinel is like a place/situation to stop a loop at.
    Sentinels can be specific values, like -1 or "" (the empty string), or they can be a range, like < 0
    Sentinels can NOT be normal/valid data
4. What is wrong with this variable name: nothingWrong
    It violates the PEP 8 naming convention by having a capital (instead of nothing_wrong)
5. What are augmented assignment operators?
    a += b is the same as a = a + b
    a *= b is the same as a = a * b
    etc.


range
a) Loop Outputs
33 34 35 36 37 38
17 16 15 14 13 12
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
100>64>36>16>4>

b) Range Values
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    range(6)
[1, 5, 9, 13]
    range(1, 14, 4)
[3, 2, 1]
    range(3, 0, -1)
[7, 4, 1, -2, -5]
    range(7, -6, -3)


Patterns
Which pattern would be the most appropriate choice for each of the following situations:

1. Error-checking user input, looping until they enter a valid response
    indefinite
2. A menu with several options including 'quit'
    indefinite
3. Displaying all the months in a year
    definite
4. Printing 5 random numbers
    definite
5. Printing n random numbers, where n is a user input
    definite
