CP1401 Practical 01 - Problem Solving - Suggested Solutions

(Remember that only selected solutions are provided, not all.)

Algorithms

Don't forget to follow both our examples and our guide:
https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Pseudocode-Guide

Algorithm with I, P, O

get dose, yield
ratio = yield / dose
display ratio

Algorithm with Selection (Decision)

get money, price
if money >= price
    display can afford
else
    display can not afford

Note: we could write lots of different things to figure out how much money we have in our collection of coins, e.g.
money = add up value of coins
or
money = 0
for each coin in collection
    money = money + value of coin
etc.
But let's just keep it simple...

Algorithm with Repetition

get thing from floor
while there are things on the floor
    get thing from floor
or
repeat until floor is clean
    get thing from floor

This is a pretty "loose" question, and would not be turned into code, so we don't need a very "tight" (specific) answer.
If we were writing code to instruct a cleaning robot, then we'd need something much more complete and specific.


Problem Decomposition

"A road trip planning system will ask the user for the distance travelled (in km) and the travel time in minutes. The user will then be shown the average speed (in km/hour) over the trip."
Nouns: system, user, distance, time in minutes, average speed
Verbs: ask, shown

Algorithm

get distance, time in minutes
speed in kilometres per minute = distance / time in minutes
speed in kilometres per hour = in kilometres per hour * 60
display in kilometres per hour

Note: To help evaluate your own work, you should always TEST using values you understand.
If I were doing 25 km/hr then in 2 hours, I'd drive 50 km.
So,
distance = 50
time in minutes = 120 (2 hours)
speed in kilometres per minute = 50 / 120 (0.4166666667)
speed in kilometres per hour = 0.4166666667 * 60
speed in kilometres per hour = 25
Good.

If we had incorrectly written
speed in kilometres per hour = in kilometres per hour * 60
Then we could find out this was wrong by testing and getting 0.006944443333 hm/hr!
If we didn't test it... we wouldn't know
